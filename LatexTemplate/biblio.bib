	Abstract = {We consider a production stage that produces a single item in a make-to-stock manner. Demand for finished goods is stationary. In each time period, an updated vector of demand forecasts over the forecast horizon becomes available for use in production decisions. We model the sequence of forecast update vectors using the Martingale model of forecast evolution developed by Graves et al. (1986, 1998) and Heath and Jackson (1994). The production stage is modeled as a single-server, discrete-time, continuous-state queue. We focus on a modified base-stock policy incorporating forecast information and use an approximate analysis rooted in heavy traffic theory and random walk theory to obtain a closed-form expression for the (forecast-corrected) base-stock level that minimizes the expected steady-state inventory holding and backorder costs. This expression, which is shown to be accurate under certain conditions in a simulation study, sheds some light on the interrelationships among safety stock, stochastic correlated demand, inaccurate forecasts, and random and capacitated production in forecasting-production-inventory systems.},

	Abstract = {Optimal solutions to Markov decision problems may be very sensitive with respect to the state transition probabilities. In many practical problems, the estimation of these probabilities is far from accurate. Hence, estimation errors are limiting factors in applying Markov decision processes to real-world problems.We consider a robust control problem for a finite-state, finite-action Markov decision process, where uncertainty on the transition matrices is described in terms of possibly nonconvex sets. We show that perfect duality holds for this problem, and that as a consequence, it can be solved with a variant of the classical dynamic programming algorithm, the ``robust dynamic programming'' algorithm. We show that a particular choice of the uncertainty sets, involving likelihood regions or entropy bounds, leads to both a statistically accurate representation of uncertainty, and a complexity of the robust recursion that is almost the same as that of the classical recursion. Hence, robustness can be added at practically no extra computing cost. We derive similar results for other uncertainty sets, including one with a finite number of possible values for the transition matrices.We describe in a practical path planning example the benefits of using a robust strategy instead of the classical optimal strategy; even if the uncertainty level is only crudely guessed, the robust strategy yields a much better worst-case expected travel time.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show a significant role that geometric properties of uncertainty sets, such as symmetry, play in determining the power of robust and finitely adaptable solutions in multistage stochastic and adaptive optimization problems. We consider a fairly general class of multistage mixed integer stochastic and adaptive optimization problems and propose a good approximate solution policy with performance guarantees that depend on the geometric properties of the uncertainty sets. In particular, we show that a class of finitely adaptable solutions is a good approximation for both the multistage stochastic and the adaptive optimization problem. A finitely adaptable solution generalizes the notion of a static robust solution and specifies a small set of solutions for each stage; the solution policy implements the best solution from the given set, depending on the realization of the uncertain parameters in past stages. Therefore, it is a tractable approximation to a fully adaptable solution for the multistage problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first approximation results for the multistage problem in such generality. Moreover, the results and the proof techniques are quite general and also extend to include important constraints such as integrality and linear conic constraints.},

The goal is to determine the right base-stock level for each item and to identify the key driving factors. We formulate a cost-minimization model with order-based backorder costs and compare it with the standard single-item, newsvendor-type model with item-based backorder cost. We show that the solution of the former can be bounded by that of the latter with appropriately imputed parameters. Starting with this upper bound, the optimal base-stock levels of the order-based problem can be obtained in a greedy fashion. We also show that the optimal base-stock levels increase in replenishment lead times but may increase or decrease in lead-time variability and demand correlation. Finally, we devise closed-form approximations of the optimal base-stock levels to see more clearly their dependence on the system parameters.},

	Abstract = {The goal of choice-theoretic derivations of subjective probability is to separate a decision maker's underlying beliefs (subjective probabilities of events) from their preferences (attitudes toward risk). Classical derivations have all relied upon some form of the Marschak-Samuelson "Independence Axiom" or the Savage "Sure-Thing Principle," which imply that preferences over lotteries conform to the expected utility hypothesis. This paper presents a choice-theoretic derivation of subjective probability, in a Savage-type setting of purely subjective uncertainty, which neither assumes nor implies that the decision maker's preferences over lotteries necessarily conform to the expected utility hypothesis.},

@article{Hsu:2005,
	Abstract = {Much is known about how people make decisions under varying levels of probability (risk). Less is known about the neural basis of decision-making when probabilities are uncertain because of missing information (ambiguity). In decision theory, ambiguity about probabilities should not affect choices. Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices. These data suggest a general neural circuit responding to degrees of uncertainty, contrary to decision theory. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {Many auctions involve the sale of a variety of distinct assets. Examples are airport time slots, delivery routes, network routing, and furniture. Because of complementarities or substitution effects between the different assets, bidders have preferences not just for particular items but for sets of items. For this reason, economic efficiency is enhanced if bidders are allowed to bid on bundles or combinations of different assets. This paper surveys the state of knowledge about the design of combinatorial auctions and presents some new insights. Periodic updates of portions of this survey will be posted to this journal's Online Supplements web page at http://joc.pubs.informs.org/OnlineSupplements.html

	Abstract = {This paper concerns the problems of quadratic hedging and pricing, and mean-variance portfolio selection in an incomplete market setting with continuous trading, multiple assets, and Brownian information. In particular, we assume throughout that the parameters describing the market model may be random processes. We approach these problems from the perspective of linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs); that is, we focus on the so-called stochastic Riccati equation (SRE) associated with the problem. Excepting certain special cases, solvability of the SRE remains an open question. Our primary theoretical contribution is a proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SRE associated with the quadratic hedging and mean-variance problems. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal portfolios and efficient frontier in terms of the solution of the SRE. A generalization of the Mutual Fund Theorem is also obtained.

@article{AlbertoCaprara09011999,
	Abstract = {We present a Lagrangian-based heuristic for the well-known Set Covering Problem (SCP). The algorithm was initially designed for solving very large scale SCP instances, involving up to 5,000 rows and 1,000,000 columns, arising from crew scheduling in the Italian Railway Company, Ferrovie dello Stato SpA. In 1994 Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, jointly with the Italian Operational Research Society, organized a competition, called FASTER, intended to promote the development of algorithms capable of producing good solutions for these instances, since the classical approaches meet with considerable difficulties in tackling them. The main characteristics of the algorithm we propose are (1) a dynamic pricing scheme for the variables, akin to that used for solving large-scale LPs, to be coupled with subgradient optimization and greedy algorithms, and (2) the systematic use of column fixing to obtain improved solutions. Moreover, we propose a number of improvements on the standard way of defining the step-size and the ascent direction within the subgradient optimization procedure, and the scores within the greedy algorithms. Finally, an effective refining procedure is proposed. Our code won the first prize in the FASTER competition, giving the best solution value for all the proposed instances. The algorithm was also tested on the test instances from the literature: in 92 out of the 94 instances in our test bed we found, within short computing time, the optimal (or the best known) solution. Moreover, among the 18 instances for which the optimum is not known, in 6 cases our solution is better than any other solution found by previous techniques.

@article{Iyengar_2005_robust_DP,
	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a robust formulation for discrete time dynamic programming (DP). The objective of the robust formulation is to systematically mitigate the sensitivity of the DP optimal policy to ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. The ambiguity is modeled by associating a set of conditional measures with each state-action pair. Consequently, in the robust formulation each policy has a set of measures associated with it. We prove that when this set of measures has a certain "rectangularity" property, all of the main results for finite and infinite horizon DP extend to natural robust counterparts. We discuss techniques from Nilim and El Ghaoui [17] for constructing suitable sets of conditional measures that allow one to efficiently solve for the optimal robust policy. We also show that robust DP is equivalent to stochastic zero-sum games with perfect information.

	Abstract = {An act maps states of nature to outcomes; deterministic outcomes as well as random outcomes are included. Two acts f and g are comonotonic, by definition, if it never happens that f(s)>f(t) and g(t)>g(s) for some states of nature s and t. An axiom of comonotonic independence is introduced here. It weakens the von Neumann-Morgenstern axiom of independence as follows: If f>g and if f, g, and h are comonotonic, then @af+(1-@a)h>@ag+(1-@a)h. If a nondegenerate, cOntinuous, and monotonic (state independent) weak order over acts satisfies comonotonic independence, then it induces a unique non-(necessarily-)additive probability and a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility. Furthermore, one can compute the expected utility of an act with respect to the nonadditive probability, using the Choquet integral. This extension of the expected utility theory covers situations, as the Ellsbergparadox, which are inconsistent with additive expected utility. The concept of uncertainty aversion and interpretation of comonotonic independence in the context of social welfare functions are included.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the consequences of the following modification of expected utility theory: Instead of requiring independence with respect to probability mixtures of risky prospects, require independence with respect to direct mixing of payments of risky prospects. A new theory of choice under risk--a so-called dual theory--is obtained. Within this new theory, the following questions are considered: (i) numerical representation of preferences; (ii) properties of the utility function; (iii) the possibility for resolving the "paradoxes" of expected utility theory; (iv) the characterization of risk aversion; (v) comparative statics. The paper ends with a discussion of other non-expected-utility theories proposed recently.},

	Abstract = { We extend the definition of a convex risk measure to a conditional framework where additional information is available. We characterize these risk measures through the associated acceptance sets and prove a representation result in terms of conditional expectations. A suitable regularity property of conditional risk measures is defined and discussed. Finally, we introduce the concept of a dynamic convex risk measure as a family of successive conditional convex risk measures and characterize those satisfying some natural time consistency properties. As a reference example, illustrating all the proposed developments, we introduce a suitably defined dynamic version of the class of entropic risk measures.

@article{Bertsimas_Nino_Mora_1996,
	Abstract = {We show that if performance measures in stochastic and dynamic scheduling problems satisfy generalized conservation laws, then the feasible region of achievable performance is a polyhedron called an extended polymatroid, that generalizes the classical polymatroids introduced by Edmonds. Optimization of a linear objective over an extended polymatroid is solved by an adaptive greedy algorithm, which leads to an optimal solution having an indexability property (indexable systems). Under a certain condition the indices possess a stronger decomposition property (decomposable systems). The following problems can be analyzed using our theory: multiarmed bandit problems, branching bandits, scheduling of multiclass queues (with or without feedback), scheduling of a batch of jobs. Consequences of our results include: (1) a characterization of indexable systems as systems that satisfy generalized conservation laws, (2) a sufficient condition for indexable systems to be decomposable, (3) a new linear programming proof of the decomposability property of Gittins indices in multiarmed bandit problems, (4) an approach to sensitivity analysis of indexable systems, (5) a characterization of the indices of indexable systems as sums of dual variables, and an economic interpretation of the branching bandit indices in terms of retirement options, (6) an analysis of the indexability of undiscounted branching bandits, (7) a new algorithm to compute the indices of indexable systems (in particular Gittins indices), as fast as the fastest known algorithm, (8) a unification of Klimov's algorithm for multiclass queues and Gittms' algorithm for multiarmed bandits as special cases of the same algorithm, (9) a closed formula for the maximum reward of the multiarmed bandit problem, with a new proof of its submodularity and (10) an understanding of the invariance of the indices with respect to some parameters of the problem. Our approach provides a polyhedral treatment of several classical problems in stochastic and dynamic scheduling and is able to address variations such as: discounted versus undiscounted cost criterion, rewards versus taxes, discrete versus continuous time, and linear versus nonlinear objective functions.

@article{Tardella_2008_sum_decomposab,
	Abstract = {Convex envelopes are a very useful tool in global optimization. However finding the exact convex envelope of a function is a difficult task in general. This task becomes considerably simpler in the case where the domain is a polyhedron and the convex envelope is vertex polyhedral, i.e., has a polyhedral epigraph whose vertices correspond to the vertices of the domain. A further simplification is possible when the convex envelope is sum decomposable, i.e., the convex envelope of a sum of functions coincides with the sum of the convex envelopes of the summands. In this paper we provide characterizations and sufficient conditions for the existence of a vertex polyhedral convex envelope. Our results extend and unify several results previously obtained for special cases of this problem. We then characterize sum decomposability of vertex polyhedral convex envelopes, and we show, among else, that the vertex polyhedral convex envelope of a sum of functions coincides with the sum of the vertex polyhedral convex envelopes of the summands if and only if the latter sum is vertex polyhedral.},

@article{Lai_Margot_Secomandi,
	Abstract = {The valuation of the real option to store natural gas is a practically important problem that entails dynamic optimization of inventory trading decisions with capacity constraints in the face of uncertain natural gas price dynamics. Stochastic dynamic programming is a natural approach to this valuation problem, but it does not seem to be widely used in practice because it is at odds with the high-dimensional natural gas price evolution models that are widespread among traders. According to the practice-based literature, practitioners typically value natural gas storage heuristically. The effectiveness of the heuristics discussed in this literature is currently unknown because good upper bounds on the value of storage are not available. We develop a novel and tractable approximate dynamic programming method that, coupled with Monte Carlo simulation, computes lower and upper bounds on the value of storage, which we use to benchmark these heuristics on a set of realistic instances. We find that these heuristics are extremely fast to execute but significantly suboptimal compared to our upper bound, which appears to be fairly tight and much tighter than a simpler perfect information upper bound; computing our lower bound takes more time than using these heuristics, but our lower bound substantially outperforms them in terms of valuation. Moreover, with periodic reoptimizations embedded in Monte Carlo simulation, the practice-based heuristics become nearly optimal, with one exception, at the expense of higher computational effort. Our lower bound with reoptimization is also nearly optimal, but exhibits a higher computational requirement than these heuristics. Besides natural gas storage, our results are potentially relevant for the valuation of the real option to store other commodities, such as metals, oil, and petroleum products.

	Abstract = {
We address several basic questions that arise in the use of projection in combinatorial optimization. Central to these is the connection between the dimension of a polyhedron Q and the dimension of its projection on a subspace. We give the exact relationship between the two dimensions. As a byproduct we characterize the relationship between the equality subsystem of a polyhedron and that of its projection. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a face (in particular, a facet) of a polyhedron Q to project into a face (a facet) of the projection of Q, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a 1-1 correspondence between the faces of Q and those of its projection. More generally, we characterize the dimensional relationship between the projection of Q and that of an arbitrary proper face of Q. We also show that the projection of a monotonized polyhedron on a subspace is the monotonization of the projection of the polyhedron on the same subspace.},

	Abstract = {A well-known result on unions of polyhedra in the same space gives an extended formulation in a higher-dimensional space whose projection is the convex hull of the union. Here in contrast we study the unions of polytopes in different spaces, giving a complete description of the convex hull without additional variables. When the underlying polytopes are monotone, the facets are described explicitly, generalizing results of Hong and Hooker on cardinality rules, and an efficient separation algorithm is proposed. These results are based on an explicit representation of the dominant of a polytope, and an algorithm for the separation problem for the dominant. For non-monotone polytopes, both the dominant and the union are characterized. We also give results on the unions of polymatroids both on disjoint ground sets and on the same ground set generalizing results of Conforti and Laurent.},

@article{VishalGaur01012005,
	Abstract = {We address the problem of hedging inventory risk for a short life cycle or seasonal item when its demand is correlated with the price of a financial asset. We show how to construct optimal hedging transactions that minimize the variance of profit and increase the expected utility for a risk-averse decision maker. We show that for a wide range of hedging strategies and utility functions, a risk-averse decision maker orders more inventory when he or she hedges the inventory risk. Our results are useful to both risk-neutral and risk-averse decision makers because (1) the price information of the financial asset is used to determine both the optimal inventory level and the hedge, (2) this enables the decision maker to update the demand forecast and the financial hedge as more information becomes available, and (3) hedging leads to lower risk and higher return on inventory investment. We illustrate these benefits using data from a retailing firm.

@article{Mendelson_Tunca_2007,
	Abstract = {In a variety of industries ranging from agriculture to electronics and oil, procurement takes place through a combination of bilateral fixed-price contracts and open market trading among supply chain participants, which allows them to improve supply chain performance by utilizing new demand and cost information. The strategic behavior of the participants in these markets interacts with the way fixed-price contracts are formulated and significantly affects supply chain efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate fixed-price contracting even though the fixed price is determined under inferior information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus. However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain, spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement shifts from fixed-price contracting to spot trading and in the limit, the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the manufacturers.

Finally, we solve some problems commonly encountered in operations management to demonstrate the methodology.

@article{Celik_Muharremoglu_Savin_2009,
	Abstract = {We consider a novel variant of the perishable inventory profit management problem faced by a firm that sells a fixed inventory over a finite horizon in the presence of price-adjustment costs. In economics literature, such price-adjustment costs are widely studied and are typically assumed to include a fixed component (e.g., advertising costs), an inventory-dependent component (e.g., inventory relabeling costs), as well as a component that depends on the magnitude of the price adjustment (e.g., cognitive and coordination managerial costs).  We formulate the firm's profit management problem as a finite-horizon dynamic program in which the state of the system is described by the inventory level as well as the current price level. We derive first-order properties of the optimal value function and give a complete characterization of optimal policies for the case of ample inventory. Through a set of examples we demonstrate the complex and counterintuitive nature of optimal price-adjustment policies. Consequently, we focus on developing easily computable and implementable heuristics with demonstrably good performance. To this end, we develop and solve a fluid model based on the original stochastic dynamics and propose three fluid-based heuristic policies. We derive expressions for the expected profit generated by each one of these heuristics when applied to the stochastic problem and derive sufficient conditions for the asymptotic optimality of the policies when the initial inventory levels and planning horizons are proportionally scaled up. We test the performance of the heuristics in a numerical study and demonstrate a robust, near-optimal performance of one of the heuristics (which we call the "Fluid Time" heuristic) for a wide range of problem parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of proper accounting of price-adjustment costs in several alternative business settings.

@article{CananUlu05012009,
	Abstract = {Consumers or firms contemplating purchasing a new product or adopting a new technology are often plagued by uncertainty: Will the benefits outweigh the costs? Should we buy now or wait and gather more information? In this paper, we study a dynamic programming model of this technology adoption problem. In each period, the consumer decides whether to adopt the technology, reject it, or wait and gather additional information by observing a signal about the technology's benefit. The technology's actual benefit may be constant or changing stochastically over time. The dynamic programming state variable is a probability distribution that describes the consumer's beliefs about the benefits of the technology. We allow general probability distributions on benefits and general signal processes and assume that the consumer updates her beliefs over time using Bayes' rule. We are interested in structural properties of this model. We show that improving the technology's benefit need not make the consumer better off and that first-order stochastic dominance improvements in the consumer's distribution on benefits need not increase the consumer's value function. Nevertheless, the model possesses a great deal of structure. For example, we obtain monotonic value functions and policies if we order distributions using likelihood-ratio dominance rather than first-order stochastic dominance. We also examine convexity properties and provide many comparative statics results.

	Abstract = {We consider a two-stage mixed integer stochastic optimization problem and show that a static robust solution is a good approximation to the fully adaptable two-stage solution for the stochastic problem under fairly general assumptions on the uncertainty set and the probability distribution. In particular, we show that if the right-hand side of the constraints is uncertain and belongs to a symmetric uncertainty set (such as hypercube, ellipsoid or norm ball) and the probability measure is also symmetric, then the cost of the optimal fixed solution to the corresponding robust problem is at most twice the optimal expected cost of the two-stage stochastic problem. Furthermore, we show that the bound is tight for symmetric uncertainty sets and can be arbitrarily large if the uncertainty set is not symmetric. We refer to the ratio of the optimal cost of the robust problem and the optimal cost of the two-stage stochastic problem as the stochasticity gap. We also extend the bound on the stochasticity gap for another class of uncertainty sets referred to as positive.  If both the objective coefficients and right-hand side are uncertain, we show that the stochasticity gap can be arbitrarily large even if the uncertainty set and the probability measure are both symmetric. However, we prove that the adaptability gap (ratio of optimal cost of the robust problem and the optimal cost of a two-stage fully adaptable problem) is at most four even if both the objective coefficients and the right-hand side of the constraints are uncertain and belong to a symmetric uncertainty set. The bound holds for the class of positive uncertainty sets as well. Moreover, if the uncertainty set is a hypercube (special case of a symmetric set), the adaptability gap is one under an even more general model of uncertainty where the constraint coefficients are also uncertain.

	Abstract = {We analyze an infinite horizon, single-product, periodic review model in which pricing and production/inventory decisions are made simultaneously. Demands in different periods are identically distributed random variables that are independent of each other, and their distributions depend on the product price. Pricing and ordering decisions are made at the beginning of each period, and all shortages are backlogged. Ordering cost includes both a fixed cost and a variable cost proportional to the amount ordered. The objective is to maximize expected discounted, or expected average, profit over the infinite planning horizon. We show that a stationary (s,S,p) policy is optimal for both the discounted and average profit models with general demand functions. In such a policy, the period inventory is managed based on the classical (s,S) policy, and price is determined based on the inventory position at the beginning of each period.

@article{Gallego_vanRyzin_multiprod_1997,
	Abstract = {A firm has inventories of a set of components that are used to produce a set of products. There is a finite horizon over which the firm can sell its products. Demand for each product is a stochastic point process with an intensity that is a function of the vector of prices for the products and the time at which these prices are offered. The problem is to price the finished products so as to maximize total expected revenue over the finite sales horizon. An upper bound on the optimal expected revenue is established by analyzing a deterministic version of the problem. The solution to the deterministic problem suggests two heuristics for the stochastic problem that are shown to be asymptotically optimal as the expected sales volume tends to infinity. Several applications of the model to network yield management are given. Numerical examples illustrate both the range of problems that can be modeled under this framework and the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics. The results provide several fundamental insights into the performance of yield management systems.

Our results cover the finite-horizon case, with minimax (worst-case) objective, and convex state costs plus linear control costs. We develop a new proof methodology, which explores the relationship between the geometrical properties of the feasible set of solutions and the structure of the objective function. Apart from providing an elegant and conceptually simple proof technique, the approach also entails very fast algorithms for the case of piecewise-affine state costs, which we explore in connection with a classical inventory management application.

	Abstract = {We consider a single-product revenue management problem where, given an initial inventory, the objective is to dynamically adjust prices over a finite sales horizon to maximize expected revenues. Realized demand is observed over time, but the underlying functional relationship between price and mean demand rate that governs these observations (otherwise known as the demand function or demand curve) is not known. We consider two instances of this problem: (i) a setting where the demand function is assumed to belong to a known parametric family with unknown parameter values; and (ii) a setting where the demand function is assumed to belong to a broad class of functions that need not admit any parametric representation. In each case we develop policies that learn the demand function "on the fly," and optimize prices based on that. The performance of these algorithms is measured in terms of the regret: the revenue loss relative to the maximal revenues that can be extracted when the demand function is known prior to the start of the selling season. We derive lower bounds on the regret that hold for any admissible pricing policy, and then show that our proposed algorithms achieve a regret that is "close" to this lower bound. The magnitude of the regret can be interpreted as the economic value of prior knowledge on the demand function, manifested as the revenue loss due to model uncertainty.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the classical multifare, single-resource (leg) problem in revenue management for the case where demand information is limited. Our approach employs a competitive analysis, which guarantees a certain performance level under all possible demand scenarios. The only information required about the demand for each fare class is lower and upper bounds. We consider both competitive ratio and absolute regret performance criteria. For both performance criteria, we derive the best possible static policies, which employ booking limits that remain constant throughout the booking horizon. The optimal policies have the form of nested booking limits. Dynamic policies, which employ booking limits that may be adjusted at any time based on the history of bookings, are also obtained. We provide extensive computational experiments and compare our methods to existing ones. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these new robust methods.

@article{Andrew_Lim03012007,
	Abstract = {In the area of dynamic revenue management, optimal pricing policies are typically computed on the basis of an underlying demand rate model. From the perspective of applications, this approach implicitly assumes that the model is an accurate representation of the real-world demand process and that the parameters characterizing this model can be accurately calibrated using data. In many situations, neither of these conditions are satisfied. Indeed, models are usually simplified for the purpose of tractability and may be difficult to calibrate because of a lack of data. Moreover, pricing policies that are computed under the assumption that the model is correct may perform badly when this is not the case. This paper presents an approach to single-product dynamic revenue management that accounts for errors in the underlying model at the optimization stage. Uncertainty in the demand rate model is represented using the notion of relative entropy, and a tractable reformulation of the "robust pricing problem" is obtained using results concerning the change of probability measure for point processes. The optimal pricing policy is obtained through a version of the so-called Isaacs' equation for stochastic differential games, and the structural properties of the optimal solution are obtained through an analysis of this equation. In particular, (i) closed-form solutions for the special case of an exponential nominal demand rate model, (ii) general conditions for the exchange of the "max" and the "min" in the differential game, and (iii) the equivalence between the robust pricing problem and that of single-product revenue management with an exponential utility function without model uncertainty, are established through the analysis of this equation.

	Abstract = {We provide an optimization framework for computing optimal upper and lower bounds on functional expectations of distributions with special properties, given moment constraints. Bertsimas and Popescu (Optimal inequalities in probability theory: a convex optimization approach. SIAM J. Optim. 2004. Forthcoming) have already shown how to obtain optimal moment inequalities for arbitrary distributions via semidefinite programming. These bounds are not sharp if the underlying distributions possess additional structural properties, including symmetry, unimodality, convexity, or smoothness. For convex distribution classes that are in some sense generated by an appropriate parametric family, we use conic duality to show how optimal moment bounds can be efficiently computed as semidefinite programs. In particular, we obtain generalizations of Chebyshev's inequality for symmetric and unimodal distributions and provide numerical calculations to compare these bounds, given higher-order moments. We also extend these results for multivariate distributions.

	Abstract = {Stochastic programming can effectively describe many decision-making problems in uncertain environments. Unfortunately, such programs are often computationally demanding to solve. In addition, their solution can be misleading when there is ambiguity in the choice of a distribution for the random parameters. In this paper, we propose a model that describes uncertainty in both the distribution form (discrete, Gaussian, exponential, etc.) and moments (mean and covariance matrix). We demonstrate that for a wide range of cost functions the associated distributionally robust (or min-max) stochastic program can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, by deriving a new confidence region for the mean and the covariance matrix of a random vector, we provide probabilistic arguments for using our model in problems that rely heavily on historical data. These arguments are confirmed in a practical example of portfolio selection, where our framework leads to better-performing policies on the "true" distribution underlying the daily returns of financial assets.

	Abstract = {Inference in the inequality constrained normal linear regression model is approached as a problem in Bayesian inference, using a prior that is the product of a conventional uninformative distribution and an indicator function representing the inequality constraints. The posterior distribution is calculated using Monte Carlo numerical integration, which leads directly to the evaluation of expected values of functions of interest. This approach is compared with others that have been proposed. Three empirical examples illustrate the utility of the proposed methods using an inexpensive 32-bit microcomputer.},

	Abstract = {The benefits of dynamic pricing methods have long been known in industries, such as airlines, hotels, and electric utilities, where the capacity is fixed in the short-term and perishable. In recent years, there has been an increasing adoption of dynamic pricing policies in retail and other industries, where the sellers have the ability to store inventory. Three factors contributed to this phenomenon: (1) the increased availability of demand data, (2) the ease of changing prices due to new technologies, and (3) the availability of decision-support tools for analyzing demand data and for dynamic pricing. This paper constitutes a review of the literature and current practices in dynamic pricing. Given its applicability in most markets and its increasing adoption in practice, our focus is on dynamic (intertemporal) pricing in the presence of inventory considerations.

	Abstract = {The spiral-down effect occurs when incorrect assumptions about customer behavior cause high-fare ticket sales, protection levels, and revenues to systematically decrease over time. If an airline decides how many seats to protect for sale at a high fare based on past high-fare sales, while neglecting to account for the fact that availability of low-fare tickets will reduce high-fare sales, then high-fare sales will decrease, resulting in lower future estimates of high-fare demand. This subsequently yields lower protection levels for high-fare tickets, greater availability of low-fare tickets, and even lower high-fare ticket sales. The pattern continues, resulting in a so-called spiral down. We develop a mathematical framework to analyze the process by which airlines forecast demand and optimize booking controls over a sequence of flights. Within the framework, we give conditions under which spiral down occurs.

	Abstract = {Revenue management models traditionally assume that future demand is unknown but can be described by a stochastic process or a probability distribution. Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.

	Abstract = {This note extends some of the key results of Dong and Rudi (2004) to general demand distributions. This generalization is achieved in two steps. First, we build on the analysis of Dong and Rudi to demonstrate that an inventory problem with transshipment is equivalent to a newsvendor problem with an adjusted demand. Then, we study the impact of transshipment by comparing the adjusted demand with the original demand. In addition to extending the results in the existing literature, this note presents a novel approach for analyzing the impact of risk pooling.

	Abstract = {This paper studies how transshipments affect manufacturers and retailers, considering both exogenous and endogenous wholesale prices. For a distribution system where a single manufacturer sells to multiple identical-cost retailers, we consider both the manufacturer being a price taker and the manufacturer being a price setter in a single-period setup under multivariate normal demand distribution. In the case of the manufacturer being a price taker, we provide several analytical results regarding the effects of key parameters on order quantities and profits. In the case of the manufacturer being a price setter, we characterize the Stackelberg game that arises, and provide several insights into how the game dynamics are affected by transshipments. Specifically, we find that risk pooling makes retailers' order quantities less sensitive to the wholesale price set by the manufacturer; hence, in general, the manufacturer benefits from retailers' transshipments by charging a higher wholesale price, while retailers are often worse off. The paper captures the effect of demand correlation and the effect of the number of retailers throughout, and it illustrates the findings by a numerical example. We also provide an interactive Web page for numerical experiments.

	Abstract = {The problem of optimum inventory policies is posed in the same way 
as in [1]. During equal time intervals, a warehouse which initially contains 
the quantity x of goods, receives demands for the goodsindependent 
identically distributed non-negative random variables with distribution 
function O(s), having a density tp(s) > 0 for s > 0, and with finite mathematical 
expectation E #. It is assumed that before receiving the next demand an 
order is made for the replenishment of the warehouse, for which a cost is 
payed. In contrast to [1], where the cost was a linear function of the amount 
of the order, it is assumed here to be a convex function. The optimum be- 
havior obtained will differ from the optimum behavior for the linear case. 
Unsatisfied demands wait for the replenishment of the warehouse. 
Besides the cost for the replenishment of the inventories, a penalty is taken 
into account for the insufficiency of goods in order to satisfy the demand 
p(-) received, as well as a cost for storage h(. ). It is necessary to choose a 
method of replenishing the warehouse in such a way that the mean cost be 
minimized for n periods or for an infinite number of periods. Auxiliary 
assumptions on the method of replenishing the warehouse will be made in 
each of the sections. The cases cited below were not studied in 2] and 3], 
where a convex ordering cost function was also considered.},

	Abstract = {Developed by General Motors (GM), the Auto Choice Advisor website ( http://www.autochoiceadvisor.com) recommends vehicles to consumers based on their requirements and budget constraints. Through the website, GM has access to large quantities of data that reflect consumer preferences. Motivated by the availability of such data, we formulate a nonparametric approach to multiproduct pricing.  We consider a class of models of consumer purchasing behavior, each of which relates observed data on a consumer's requirements and budget constraint to subsequent purchasing tendencies. To price products, we aim at optimizing prices with respect to a sample of consumer data. We offer a bound on the sample size required for the resulting prices to be near-optimal with respect to the true distribution of consumers. The bound exhibits a dependence of O(n log n) on the number n of products being priced, showing that--in terms of sample complexity--the approach is scalable to large numbers of products.  With regards to computational complexity, we establish that computing optimal prices with respect to a sample of consumer data is NP-complete in the strong sense. However, when prices are constrained by a price ladder--an ordering of prices defined prior to price determination--the problem becomes one of maximizing a supermodular function with real-valued variables. It is not yet known whether this problem is NP-hard. We provide a heuristic for our price-ladder-constrained problem, together with encouraging computational results.  Finally, we apply our approach to a data set from the Auto Choice Advisor website. Our analysis provides insights into the current pricing policy at GM and suggests enhancements that may lead to a more effective pricing strategy.

We first describe these methods for general conic semidefinite optimization, and then apply them to solve large scale polynomial optimization.

	Abstract = {We study a class of two-echelon serial systems with identical ordering/production capacities or limits for both echelons. Demands are assumed to be integer valued. For the case where the lead time to the upstream echelon is one period, the optimality of state-dependent modified echelon base-stock policies is proved using a decomposition approach. For the case where the upstream lead time is two periods, we introduce a new class of policies called "two-tier base-stock policies," and prove their optimality. Some insight about the inventory control problem in N echelon serial systems with identical capacities at all stages and arbitrary lead times everywhere is also provided. We argue that a generalization of two-tier base-stock policies, which we call "multitier base-stock policies," are optimal for these systems; we also provide a bound on the number of parameters required to specify the optimal policy.

We present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." We examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by SPAN, by the SEC/NASD rules, and by quantile-based methods. We demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. We offer suggestions concerning the SEC method. We also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We focus on a polytopic uncertainty set described by a ``budget constraint'' for allowed uncertainty in the objective coefficients. We show that for a robust 0--1 problem, there is an Î±--tight linear programming formulation with size polynomial in the size of an Î±--tight linear programming formulation for the nominal 0--1 problem.

@article{AlperAtamturk07012007,
	Abstract = {We describe a two-stage robust optimization approach for solving network flow and design problems with uncertain demand. In two-stage network optimization, one defers a subset of the flow decisions until after the realization of the uncertain demand. Availability of such a recourse action allows one to come up with less conservative solutions compared to single-stage optimization. However, this advantage often comes at a price: two-stage optimization is, in general, significantly harder than single-stage optimization.  For network flow and design under demand uncertainty, we give a characterization of the first-stage robust decisions with an exponential number of constraints and prove that the corresponding separation problem is [N][P]-hard even for a network flow problem on a bipartite graph. We show, however, that if the second-stage network topology is totally ordered or an arborescence, then the separation problem is tractable.  Unlike single-stage robust optimization under demand uncertainty, two-stage robust optimization allows one to control conservatism of the solutions by means of an allowed "budget for demand uncertainty." Using a budget of uncertainty, we provide an upper bound on the probability of infeasibility of a robust solution for a random demand vector.  We generalize the approach to multicommodity network flow and design, and give applications to lot-sizing and location-transportation problems. By projecting out second-stage flow variables, we define an upper bounding problem for the two-stage min-max-min optimization problem. Finally, we present computational results comparing the proposed two-stage robust optimization approach with single-stage robust optimization as well as scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization.

	Abstract = {We study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier's percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse.  Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firm's costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.

@article{Kleindorfer_Saad_2005_disruption_risks,
	Abstract = {There are two broad categories of risk affecting supply chain design and management: (1) risks arising from the problems of coordinating supply and demand, and (2) risks arising from disruptions to normal activities. This paper is concerned with the second category of risks, which may arise from natural disasters, from strikes and economic disruptions, and from acts of purposeful agents, including terrorists. The paper provides a conceptual framework that reflects the joint activities of risk assessment and risk mitigation that are fundamental to disruption risk management in supply chains. We then consider empirical results from a rich data set covering the period 1995--2000 on accidents in the U.S. Chemical Industry. Based on these results and other literature, we discuss the implications for the design of management systems intended to cope with supply chain disruption risks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Hendricks_Singhal_2005_empirical_disruptions,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the long-term stock price effects and equity risk effects of supply chain disruptions based on a sample of 827 disruption announcements made during 1989--2000. Stock price effects are examined starting one year before through two years after the disruption announcement date. Over this time period the average abnormal stock returns of firms that experienced disruptions is nearly âˆ’40%. Much of this underperformance is observed in the year before the announcement, the day of the announcement, and the year after the announcement. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that firms do not quickly recover from the negative effects of disruptions. The equity risk of the firm also increases significantly around the announcement date. The equity risk in the year after the announcement is 13.50% higher when compared to the equity risk in the year before the announcement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{AlexandarAngelus05012008,
	Abstract = {We formulate a finite-horizon nonstationary dynamic single-asset assembly problem, which covers both a liquid-asset assembly problem, based on the work of Rosling published in 1989, where the single asset is the single product being assembled, and a fixed-asset assembly problem, in which the single asset is production capacity. In the latter case, capacity is assembled over time from components and may be used to manufacture many products. In the spirit of Rosling, we provide conditions under which it can be solved by an equivalent analogous serial model in the form developed by Clark and Scarf in 1960, with a separate state variable for the level of assets in each stage of completion, dramatically simplifying the problem and its solution. In the liquid-asset case, we extend Rosling's 1989 work by including nonstationary demands, costs, and revenues in a finite-horizon setting. In the fixed-asset (capacity) expansion case, we show that capacity should be assembled in a balanced way and derive the optimal timing and extent of delays (in previously initiated capacity expansions). Our basic capacity expansion model is deterministic, so under our conditions, it is optimal never to delay a schedule and the state space reduces to a single dimension. However, in the Markov-modulated case, in which cost parameters and customer demand distributions can be influenced by a randomly and exogenously evolving state (of the economy), we illustrate that delays can be optimal.

	Abstract = {Most models of multilevel production and distribution systems assume unlimited production capacity at each site. When capacity limits are introduced, an ineffective policy may lead to increasingly large order backlogs: The stability of the system becomes an issue. In this paper, we examine the stability of a multi-echelon system in which each node has limited production capacity and operates under a base-stock policy. We show that if the mean demand per period is smaller than the capacity at every node, then inventories and backlogs are stable, having a unique stationary distribution to which they converge from all initial states. Under i.i.d. demands we show that the system is a Harris ergodic Markov chain and is thus wide-sense regenerative. Under a slightly stronger condition, inventories return to their target levels infinitely often, with probability one. We discuss cost implications of these results, and give extensions to systems with random lead times and periodic demands.

@article{Chen_Song_optimal_policies_multiechel_2001,
	Abstract = {This paper considers a multistage serial inventory system with Markov-modulated demand. Random demand arises at Stage 1, Stage 1 orders from Stage 2, etc., and Stage N orders from an outside supplier with unlimited stock. The demand distribution in each period is determined by the current state of an exogenous Markov chain. Excess demand is backlogged. Linear holding costs are incurred at every stage, and linear backorder costs are incurred at Stage 1. The ordering costs are also linear. The objective is to minimize the long-run average costs in the system. The paper shows that the optimal policy is an echelon base-stock policy with state-dependent order-up-to levels. An efficient algorithm is also provided for determining the optimal base-stock levels. The results can be extended to serial systems in which there is a fixed ordering cost at stage N and to assembly systems with linear ordering costs.

	Abstract = {We present an optimization approach for jointly learning the demand as a function of price, and dynamically setting prices of products in order to maximize expected revenue. The models we consider do not assume that the demand as a function of price is known in advance, but rather assume parametric families of demand functions that are learned over time. In the first part of the paper, we consider the noncompetitive case and present dynamic programming algorithms of increasing computational intensity with incomplete state information for jointly estimating the demand and setting prices as time evolves. Our computational results suggest that dynamic programming based methods outperform myopic policies often significantly. In the second part of the paper, we consider a competitive oligopolistic environment. We introduce a more sophisticated model of demand learning, in which the price elasticities are slowly varying functions of time, and allows for increased flexibility in the modeling of the demand. We propose methods based on optimization for jointly estimating the Firm's own demand, its competitors' demands, and setting prices. In preliminary computational work, we found that optimization based pricing methods offer increased expected revenue for a firm independently of the policy the competitor firm is following. },

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a methodology for constructing uncertainty sets within the framework of robust optimization for linear optimization problems with uncertain parameters. Our approach relies on decision maker risk preferences. Specifically, we utilize the theory of coherent risk measures initiated by Artzner et al. (1999) [Artzner, P., F. Delbaen, J. Eber, D. Heath. 1999. Coherent measures of risk. Math. Finance 9 203-228.], and show that such risk measures, in conjunction with the support of the uncertain parameters, are equivalent to explicit uncertainty sets for robust optimization. We explore the structure of these sets in detail. In particular, we study a class of coherent risk measures, called distortion risk measures, which give rise to polyhedral uncertainty sets of a special structure that is tractable in the context of robust optimization. In the case of discrete distributions with rational probabilities, which is useful in practical settings when we are sampling from data, we show that the class of all distortion risk measures (and their corresponding polyhedral sets) are generated by a finite number of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measures. A subclass of the distortion risk measures corresponds to polyhedral uncertainty sets symmetric through the sample mean. We show that this subclass is also finitely generated and can be used to find inner approximations to arbitrary, polyhedral uncertainty sets.

@article{AwiFedergruen07012008,
	Abstract = {We analyze a planning model for a firm or public organization that needs to cover uncertain demand for a given item by procuring supplies from multiple sources. Each source faces a random yield factor with a general probability distribution. The model considers a single demand season. All supplies need to be ordered before the start of the season. The planning problem amounts to selecting which of the given set of suppliers to retain, and how much to order from each, so as to minimize total procurement costs while ensuring that the uncertain demand is met with a given probability. The total procurement costs consist of variable costs that are proportional to the total quantity delivered by the suppliers, and a fixed cost for each participating supplier, incurred irrespective of his supply level. Each potential supplier is characterized by a given fixed cost and a given distribution of his random yield factor. The yield factors at different suppliers are assumed to be independent of the season's demand, which is described by a general probability distribution.  Determining the optimal set of suppliers, the aggregate order and its allocation among the suppliers, on the basis of the exact shortfall probability, is prohibitively difficult. We have therefore developed two approximations for the shortfall probability. Although both approximations are shown to be highly accurate, the first, based on a large-deviations technique (LDT), has the advantage of resulting in a rigorous upper bound for the required total order and associated costs. The second approximation is based on a central limit theorem (CLT) and is shown to be asymptotically accurate, whereas the order quantities determined by this method are asymptotically optimal as the number of suppliers grows. Most importantly, this CLT-based approximation permits many important qualitative insights.

	Abstract = {This paper considers the relationship between pricing and ordering decisions for a monopolistic retailer facing a known demand function where, over the inventory cycle, the product may exhibit: (i) physical decay or deterioration of inventory called wastage; and (ii) decrease in market value called value drop associated with each unit of inventory on hand. The retailer is allowed to continuously vary the selling price of the product over the cycle. We introduce a notion of instantaneous margin, and use it to derive profit maximizing conditions for the retailer.  The model explains the markdown of retail goods subject to decay. It also provides guidance in determining when price changes during the cycle are worthwhile due to product aging, how often such changes should be made, and how such changes affect ordering intervals and quantities.},

@article{Gallego_vanRyzin_1994,
	Abstract = {In many industries, managers face the problem of selling a given stock of items by a deadline. We investigate the problem of dynamically pricing such inventories when demand is price sensitive and stochastic and the firm's objective is to maximize expected revenues. Examples that fit this framework include retailers selling fashion and seasonal goods and the travel and leisure industry, which markets space such as seats on airline flights, cabins on vacation cruises, and rooms in hotels that become worthless if not sold by a specific time.  We formulate this problem using intensity control and obtain structural monotonicity results for the optimal intensity (resp., price) as a function of the stock level and the length of the horizon. For a particular exponential family of demand functions, we find the optimal pricing policy in closed form. For general demand functions, we find an upper bound on the expected revenue based on analyzing the deterministic version of the problem and use this bound to prove that simple, fixed price policies are asymptotically optimal as the volume of expected sales tends to infinity. Finally, we extend our results to the case where demand is compound Poisson; only a finite number of prices is allowed; the demand rate is time varying; holding costs are incurred and cash flows are discounted; the initial stock is a decision variable; and reordering, overbooking, and random cancellations are allowed.

	Abstract = {We provide a rationale for evolutionary model building. The basic idea is that to enhance 
user acceptance it is important that one begins with a relatively simple model. Simplicity is 
desired so that managers understand models. As a manager uses the model and builds 
up experience with this decision aid, she will realize its shortcomings. The model will then 
be expanded and will lead to the increase of complexity. 
Evolutionary model building also stimulates the generalization of marketing knowledge. 
We illustrate this by discussing different extensions of the SCAN*PRO model. The pur- 
pose of published model extensions is to increase the knowledge about ``how promotions 
work'' and to provide support for more complex decisions. We summarize the generated 
knowledge about how promotions work, based on this process.

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to model demand uncertainty in pricing problems with capacitated resources that builds upon: (i) range forecasts for various product lines and (ii) bounds on the amount of the resources that can be used by the random part of the cumulative demand. The bounds are adjusted to reflect the decision-maker's risk preferences. Although revenue management traditionally assumes that enough historical observations are available to estimate the underlying probability distributions accurately, the model of uncertainty presented in this work is particularly well suited to the level of information available in real-life settings, in particular in applications with long production lead times, short shelf life or brand new products. We derive robust counterparts to the deterministic pricing problem in the case of additive uncertainty, and analyse the impact of uncertainty and risk aversion on the decision-maker's strategy.

	Abstract = {Most important decision problems--virtually all capital investments and planning situations--involve risky cash flows with uncertainties that are resolved over time. In most of these problems, the decision-maker has access to financial markets and may borrow and lend to smooth consumption over time. Yet, because of the difficulty of incorporating these borrowing and lending decisions into the evaluation models, these opportunities are rarely explicitly modeled in decision and risk analyses of these investments. In this paper, we study the errors induced by failing to account for these borrowing and lending decisions, and we develop extensions to the standard decision and risk analysis procedures that, given certain market and preference assumptions, take these borrowing and lending opportunities into account without overburdening the evaluation models.

	Abstract = {We develop a goal-driven stochastic optimization model that considers a random objective function in achieving an aspiration level, target, or goal. Our model maximizes the shortfall-aware aspiration-level criterion, which encompasses the probability of success in achieving the aspiration level and an expected level of underperformance or shortfall. The key advantage of the proposed model is its tractability. We can obtain its solution by solving a small collection of stochastic linear optimization problems with objectives evaluated under the popular conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) measure. Using techniques in robust optimization, we propose a decision-rule-based deterministic approximation of the goal-driven optimization problem by solving subproblems whose number is a polynomial with respect to the accuracy, with each subproblem being a second-order cone optimization problem (SOCP). We compare the numerical performance of the deterministic approximation with sampling-based approximation and report the computational insights on a multiproduct newsvendor problem.

Also, the functional equation F (A, C) = F(A, B) + F(B, C) - F(B, B) is established. These results generalize to the continuous caseF(A, B)=min intOT f(t, x(t))dt, with x(t) increasing and A le x (0) le x (T) le B.

This is a special class of generalized Tchebycheff inequalities in probability theory. We study this problem within the framework of conic programming. Relying on a general approximation scheme for conic programming, we show that these bounds can be numerically computed or approximated via semidefinite programming. We also describe some applications of this class of generalized Tchebycheff inequalities in probability, finance, and inventory theory.

In this paper we propose a way to alleviate this problem in a tractable manner. We assume that the distribution of returns is partially known, in the sense that only bounds on the mean and covariance matrix are available. We define the worst-case Value-at-Risk as the largest VaR attainable, given the partial information on the returns' distribution. We consider the problem of computing and optimizing the worst-case VaR, and we show that these problems can be cast as semidefinite programs. We extend our approach to various other partial information on the distribution, including uncertainty in factor models, support constraints, and relative entropy information.

	Abstract = {Traditional stochastic inventory models assume full knowledge of the demand probability distribution. However, in practice, it is often difficult to completely characterize the demand distribution, especially in fast-changing markets. In this paper, we study the newsvendor problem with partial information about the demand distribution (e.g., mean, variance, symmetry, unimodality). In particular, we derive the order quantities that minimize the newsvendor's maximum regret of not acting optimally. Most of our solutions are tractable, which makes them attractive for practical application. Our analysis also generates insights into the choice of the demand distribution as an input to the newsvendor model. In particular, the distributions that maximize the entropy perform well under the regret criterion. Our approach can be extended to a variety of problems that require a robust but not conservative solution.

	Abstract = {In this paper we show how to formulate and solve robust portfolio selection problems. The objective of these robust formulations is to systematically combat the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio to statistical and modeling errors in the estimates of the relevant market parameters. We introduce "uncertainty structures" for the market parameters and show that the robust portfolio selection problems corresponding to these uncertainty structures can be reformulated as secondorder cone programs and, therefore, the computational effort required to solve them is comparable to that required for solving convex quadratic programs. Moreover, we show that these uncertainty structures correspond to confidence regions associated with the statistical procedures employed to estimate the market parameters. Finally, we demonstrate a simple recipe for efficiently computing robust portfolios given raw market data and a desired level of confidence.

Our results cover finite-time horizon problems as well as infinite-time horizon formulations, with either a discounted or an average cost criterion. We employ a novel approach, based on a decomposition of the problem into a series of single-unit single-customer problems that are essentially decoupled. Besides providing a simple proof technique, this approach also gives rise to efficient algorithms for the calculation of the base-stock levels.

	Abstract = {In the linear programming approach to approximate dynamic programming, one tries to solve a certain linear program--the ALP--that has a relatively small number K of variables but an intractable number M of constraints. In this paper, we study a scheme that samples and imposes a subset of m<<M constraints. A natural question that arises in this context is: How must m scale with respect to K and M in order to ensure that the resulting approximation is almost as good as one given by exact solution of the ALP? We show that, given an idealized sampling distribution and appropriate constraints on the K variables, m can be chosen independently of M and need grow only as a polynomial in K. We interpret this result in a context involving controlled queueing networks.

@article{Glass95,
	Abstract = {Effective management of inventories in large-scale production and distribution systems requires methods for bringing model solutions closer to the complexities of real systems. Motivated by this need, we develop simulation-based methods for estimating sensitivities of inventory costs with respect to policy parameters. These sensitivity estimates are useful in adjusting optimal parameters predicted by a simplified model to complexities that can be incorporated in a simulation.  We consider capacitated, multiechelon systems operating under base-stock policies and develop estimators of derivatives with respect to base-stock levels. We show that these estimates converge to the correct value for finite-horizon and infinite-horizon discounted and average cost criteria. Our methods are easy to implement and experiments suggest that they converge quickly. We illustrate their use by optimizing base-stock levels for a subsystem of the PC assembly and distribution system of a major computer manufacturer.

@article{DeCroix_Zipkin_2005,
	Abstract = {This paper considers an inventory system with an assembly structure. In addition to uncertain customer demands, the system experiences uncertain returns from customers. Some of the components in the returned products can be recovered and reused, and these units are returned to inventory. Returns complicate the structure of the system, so that the standard approach (based on reduction to an equivalent series system) no longer applies in general. We identify conditions on the item-recovery pattern and restrictions on the inventory policy under which an equivalent series system does exist. For the special case where only the end product (or all items used to assemble the end product) is recovered, we show that the system is equivalent to a series system with no policy restrictions. For the general case, we explain how and why the system becomes more problematic and propose two heuristic policies. The heuristics are easy to compute and practical to implement, and they perform well in numerical trials. Based on these numerical trials, we obtain insights into the impact of various factors on system performance. For example, we find that holding and backorder costs tend to increase when the average return rate, the variability of returns, or the number of components recovered increases. However, neither the product architecture nor the specific set of components being recovered seems to have a significant impact on these costs. Whether product recovery reduces total system costs depends on the magnitude of the additional holding and backorder costs relative to potential procurement cost savings.},

@article{IoanaPopescu05012007,
	Abstract = {We consider the dynamic pricing problem of a monopolist firm in a market with repeated interactions, where demand is sensitive to the firm's pricing history. Consumers have memory and are prone to human decision-making biases and cognitive limitations. As the firm manipulates prices, consumers form a reference price that adjusts as an anchoring standard based on price perceptions. Purchase decisions are made by assessing prices as discounts or surcharges relative to the reference price in the spirit of prospect theory.  We prove that optimal pricing policies induce a perception of monotonic prices, whereby consumers always perceive a discount, respectively surcharge, relative to their expectations. The effect is that of a skimming or penetration strategy. The firm's optimal pricing path is monotonic on the long run, but not necessarily at the introductory stage. If consumers are loss averse, we show that optimal prices converge to a constant steady-state price, characterized by a simple implicit equation; otherwise, the optimal policy cycles. The range of steady states is wider the more loss averse consumers are. Steady-state prices decrease with the strength of the reference effect and with customers' memory, all else equal. Offering lower prices to frequent customers may be suboptimal, however, if these are less sensitive to price changes than occasional buyers.  If managers ignore such long-term implications of their pricing strategy, the model indicates that they will systematically price too low and lose revenue. Our results hold under very general reference dependent demand models.

	Abstract = {Traditional inventory models focus on risk-neutral decision makers, i.e., characterizing replenishment strategies that maximize expected total profit, or equivalently, minimize expected total cost over a planning horizon. In this paper, we propose a framework for incorporating risk aversion in multiperiod inventory models as well as multiperiod models that coordinate inventory and pricing strategies. We show that the structure of the optimal policy for a decision maker with exponential utility functions is almost identical to the structure of the optimal risk-neutral inventory (and pricing) policies. These structural results are extended to models in which the decision maker has access to a (partially) complete financial market and can hedge its operational risk through trading financial securities. Computational results demonstrate that the optimal policy is relatively insensitive to small changes in the decision-maker's level of risk aversion.

	Abstract = {In most deterministic manufacturing decision models, demand is either known or induced by pricing decisions in the period that the demand is experienced. However, in more realistic market scenarios consumers make purchase decisions with respect to price, not only in the current period, but also in past and future periods. We model a joint manufacturing/pricing decision problem, accounting for that portion of demand realized in each period that is induced by the interaction of pricing decisions in the current period and in previous periods. We formulate a mathematical programming model and develop solution techniques. We identify structural properties of our models and develop closed-form solutions and effective heuristics for various special cases of our models. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments to quantify the effectiveness of our heuristics and to develop managerial insights.

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the simultaneous determination of pricing and inventory replenishment strategies in the face of demand uncertainty. More specifically, we analyze the following single item, periodic review model. Demands in consecutive periods are independent, but their distributions depend on the item's price in accordance with general stochastic demand functions. The price charged in any given period can be specified dynamically as a function of the state of the system. A replenishment order may be placed at the beginning of some or all of the periods. Stockouts are fully backlogged. We address both finite and infinite horizon models, with the objective of maximizing total expected discounted profit or its time average value, assuming that prices can either be adjusted arbitrarily (upward or downward) or that they can only be decreased. We characterize the structure of an optimal combined pricing and inventory strategy for all of the above types of models. We also develop an efficient value iteration method to compute these optimal strategies. Finally, we report on an extensive numerical study that characterizes various qualitative properties of the optimal strategies and corresponding optimal profit values.

	Abstract = {Many industries face the problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal goods such as air-conditioners or winter coats before the end of the season. Given a fixed number of seats, rooms, or coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing of a single price change from a given initial price to either a given lower or higher second price. Under mild conditions, we show that it is optimal to decrease (resp., to increase) the initial price as soon as the time-to-go falls below (resp., above) a time threshold that depends on the number of yet unsold items.

	Abstract = {This article studies a continuous-time yield management model in which reversible price changes are allowed. We assume that perishable assets are offered at a set of discrete price levels. Demand at each level is a Poisson process. To maximize the expected revenue, management controls the price dynamically as sales evolve. We show that a subset of these prices that form a concave envelope is potentially optimal. We formulate the problem into an intensity control model and derive the optimal solution in closed form. Properties of the optimal solution and their policy implementations are discussed. Numerical examples are provided.

@article{YouyiFeng03012000,
	Abstract = {It is a common practice for industries to price the same products at different levels. For example, airlines charge various fares for a common pool of seats. Seasonal products are sold at full or discount prices during different phases of the season. This article presents a model that reflects this yield management problem. The model assumes that (1) products are offered at multiple predetermined prices over time; (2) demand is price sensitive and obeys the Poisson process; and (3) price is allowed to change monotonically, i.e., either the markup or markdown policy is implemented. To maximize the expected revenue, management needs to determine the optimal times to switch between prices based on the remaining season and inventory. Major results in this research include (1) an exact solution for the continuous-time model; (2) piecewise concavity of the value function with respect to time and inventory; and (3) monotonicity of the optimal policy. The implementation of optimal policies is fairly facile because of the existence of threshold points embedded in the value function. The value function and time thresholds can be solved with a reasonable computation effort. Numerical examples are provided.

	Abstract = {Clearance pricing and end of season inventory management are challenging and important problems in retailing. Sales rates depend upon price, seasonal effects, and the remaining assortment of items available to customers. There is little time to react to observed sales, and pricing errors result in either loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be liquidated. This paper develops optimal clearance prices and inventory management policies that take into account the impact of reduced assortment and seasonal changes on sales rates. Versions of these policies have been tested and implemented at three major retail chains and these applications are summarized and discussed.},

	Abstract = {We propose a unified theory that links uncertainty sets in robust optimization to risk measures in portfolio optimization. We illustrate the correspondence between uncertainty sets and some popular risk measures in finance, and show how robust optimization can be used to generalize the concepts of these measures. We also show that by using properly defined uncertainty sets in robust optimization models, one can in fact construct coherent risk measures. Our approach to creating coherent risk measures is easy to apply in practice, and computational experiments suggest that it may lead to superior portfolio performance. Our results have implications for efficient portfolio optimization under different measures of risk.},

We formulate a stochastic dynamic programming problem and develop heuristic solutions that approximate optimal solutions satisfactorily. To compare this methodology with current practices in the industry, we conducted two sets of experiments using the expertise of a product manager of a large retail company in Chile. In the first case, we contrast the performance of the proposed methodology with the revenues obtained during the 1995 autumn-winter season. In the second case, we compare it with the performance of the experienced product manager in a "simulation-game" setting. In both cases, our methodology provides significantly better results than those obtained by current practices.},

@unpublished{Bitran_Wadhwa_1996,
	Abstract = {Retailers who sell seasonal products often suffer substantial losses due to the mismatch between 
supply and demand caused by demand uncertainty, supply inflexibility and the short sale season. 
A major source of the retailer's demand uncertainty is often the lack of information about how 
attractive the product will be to customers, and in such cases the sales observed over the course 
of the season help to provide this crucial information. In this paper, we describe a modeling 
approach for using observed sales data to update demand information over time, and show how 
this can be embedded in an optimal dynamic pricing model for seasonal products. Our technique 
utilizes the Bayesian approach commonly employed in dynamic learning models such as inventory 
models that incorporate demand learning. It is distinguished from existing approaches, however, 
by its ability to address important sources of non-stationarity in the demand distribution, such as 
price changes and changes in customers' values for the product over time. We present results from 
some preliminary computational tests which indicate that the methodology is effective in 
estimating demand under a range of conditions. They also suggest that the incorporation of 
demand learning can lead to swift price corrections early in the season, and that this can 
substantially improve revenues in the seasonal product pricing context. In addition, the 
computational results provide insights into the nature of optimal dynamic pricing strategies in 
situations of over- or under-estimation of demand.

	Abstract = {This paper studies intertemporal pricing strategies when selling perishable products 
in retail stores. Initially we present a continuous time model where a seller faces a 
stochastic arrival of customers with different valuations of the product. For this model, 
we characterize the optimal pricing policies as functions of time and inventory. We find 
necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal pricing strategy, which provide an 
efficient algorithm to compute the optimal pricing policies. This model is extended to 
consider a more realistic framework with periodic pricing reviews. We show that the 
structure of the optimal pricing policies is consistent with the procedures observed in 
practice; retail stores successively discount the product during the season and promote 
a liquidation sale at the end of the planning horizon. We also show that the loss 
experienced when implementing periodic pricing review policies instead of continuous 
time policies is small when the appropriate number of reviews is chosen. 

Finally, we generalize the model to the case of a company that has multiple retail 
stores oriented to different market segments. For this case, we develop a heuristic to 
solve real size problems; this heuristic has a satisfactory performance with respect to 
an upper bound that we derive for the optimization problem. The paper also discusses 
the broader applicability of the models to other industries that have similar features.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies intertemporal pricing policies when selling seasonal products in retail stores. We first present a continuous time model where a seller faces a stochastic arrival of customers with different valuations of the product. For this model, we characterize the optimal pricing policies as functions of time and inventory. We use this model as a benchmark against which we compare more realistic models that consider periodic pricing reviews. We show that the structure of the optimal pricing policies in this case is consistent with the procedures observed in practice; retail stores successively discount the product during the season and promote a liquidation sale at the end of the planning horizon. We also show that the loss experienced when implementing periodic pricing reviews instead of continuous policies is small when the appropriate number of reviews is chosen. Several interesting economic insights emerge from our analysis. For example, uncertainty in the demand for new products leads to higher prices, larger discounts, and more unsold inventory. Finally, we study the effect of announced discount policies on prices and profits. We show that stores that have adopted this type of strategy usually set prices such that with high probability the merchandise is sold during the first periods and the largest discounts rarely take place.

	Abstract = {We provide a method for deriving robust solutions to certain stochastic optimization problems, based on mean-covariance information about the distributions underlying the uncertain vector of returns. We prove that for a general class of objective functions, the robust solutions amount to solving a certain deterministic parametric quadratic program. We first prove a general projection property for multivariate distributions with given means and covariances, which reduces our problem to optimizing a univariate mean-variance robust objective. This allows us to use known univariate results in the multidimensional setting, and to add new results in this direction. In particular, we characterize a general class of objective functions (the so-called one- or two-point support functions), for which the robust objective is reduced to a deterministic optimization problem in one variable. Finally, we adapt a result from Geoffrion (1967a) to reduce the main problem to a parametric quadratic program. In particular, our results are true for increasing concave utilities with convex or concave-convex derivatives. Closed-form solutions are obtained for special discontinuous criteria, motivated by bonus- and commission-based incentive schemes for portfolio management. We also investigate a multiproduct pricing application, which motivates extensions of our results for the case of nonnegative and decision-dependent returns.
