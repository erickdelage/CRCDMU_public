# HOW TO ACCESS COMPUTE CANADA RESOURCES



The use of commercial software such as Matlab, Cplex, or Gurobi is also possible and not difficult to use.

Here's some links provided by Compute Canada for each one of them:
- Matlab: You could use Octave, free and open source, to execute your Matlab code, described in this [link](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Octave). Or you can use Matlab directly by compiling your code and copying the executables into Niagara and running them there, or use your License information to execute the Matlab code directly. Everything is described in this [link](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/MATLAB). This [link](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/SSH_Tunneling) could also be useful for you to tunnel to your license server.
- Gurobi: Described [here](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Gurobi).
- Cplex: Instructions [here](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/CPLEX/en).

In case you need technical assistance or you don't find your available version, you could contact the Niagara/Compute Canada support teams to have it installed for you:
